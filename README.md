##Yet Another Personal Organizer

#Prototype

Emphasis on visual representation. 

Haven't found a personal organization tool thats right for me so decided to make one. Tried Evernote, Rednote, SimpleNote, GoogleDocs. Checked out more, none of which look like what I want.

This is a prototype. The code is an absolute shit show. Im using duck tape and paperclips to get this thing demoable. After which I will completely rebuild it.
