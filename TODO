1. The Calender view, _calendar.html.erb, should be multipurpose.
   - Make it resizable. Will require change/refactor of calendar CSS. In app/assets/stylesheets/home.scss. See view file for relevent element ids.
      - Bottom corner grab style
      - header and dates-area width ~= max width as per corner grab.
      - header height ~= 10% width.
      - date area height ~= 80% width. 
      - date cells transform to match date area
      - Calendar has minimum height and width?

2. Long Term Notes
   - View will be below calendar partial at first.
