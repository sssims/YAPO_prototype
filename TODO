	Phase II - in progress
 
	Not sure what to work on, exactly (Besides UX). I'm going to use the application to the best of it's abilities and note what needs to be improved, added, then add it to this list. Phase II will be improvements deemed necessary from use. 

        - Make long term goals completable - removable from list. 
        - Make mockups for interface. The design and experience of the website are the most important things right now. 

        Phase ? - things to move in to cycle.

	- Hyperlinks
	   - href
	   - how created? 
	- UX?
	- Visual View.
	   - Not sure what I want here. Gotta use the thang and figure it out.
	- Logging?
	   - Completed long term goals.
	   - Statistics
	- DESIGN document update
